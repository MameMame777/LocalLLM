Deep Learning Approaches for Technical Document Translation: 
A Comprehensive Study

ABSTRACT
This paper presents a comprehensive study of deep learning approaches 
for technical document translation, with particular focus on English-Japanese 
translation of engineering datasheets and academic papers. We propose 
a novel architecture that combines transformer-based neural machine 
translation with domain-specific terminology recognition and quality assessment.

1. INTRODUCTION
Technical document translation presents unique challenges compared to 
general-purpose translation tasks. The high precision required for 
technical terminology, numerical values, and specialized concepts 
demands sophisticated approaches beyond conventional machine translation.

Our research addresses three key challenges:
- Accurate translation of technical terminology
- Preservation of numerical precision and units
- Maintenance of document structure and formatting

2. METHODOLOGY
We developed a multi-stage translation pipeline consisting of:
- Document type classification
- Technical terminology extraction
- Context-aware neural translation
- Post-processing quality assessment

2.1 Technical Terminology Recognition
Our system employs a comprehensive dictionary of 320+ technical terms 
covering electronics, semiconductors, and measurement instrumentation.

2.2 Neural Translation Architecture
The core translation engine uses a transformer-based architecture 
optimized for technical content, with specialized attention mechanisms 
for numerical values and technical expressions.

3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Evaluation on a dataset of 1,000 technical documents showed:
- Translation accuracy: 94.2% for technical terms
- Numerical preservation: 99.8% accuracy
- Overall quality score: 4.7/5.0 (human evaluation)

4. CONCLUSIONS
Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in technical document 
translation quality, achieving professional-grade results suitable for 
engineering and research applications.
