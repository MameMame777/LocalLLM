Model 2450 SourceMeter SMU Instrument
User Manual - Chapter 5: Measurement Functions

5.1 VOLTAGE MEASUREMENT
The Model 2450 provides high-accuracy voltage measurements with the following specifications:
• Measurement range: 200mV to 200V in 7 ranges
• Resolution: 10nV to 100μV (depending on range)  
• Accuracy: ±(0.012% + 300μV) on 200V range
• Input impedance: >10GΩ on all ranges
• NPLC settings: 0.01 to 10 (50/60Hz line cycles)

5.1.1 Measurement Procedure
To perform a voltage measurement:
1. Connect the test leads to the DUT (Device Under Test)
2. Select the appropriate measurement range
3. Configure the measurement parameters (NPLC, averaging, etc.)
4. Initiate the measurement using the MEASURE button

5.2 CURRENT MEASUREMENT  
High-precision current measurements with these capabilities:
• Measurement range: 10nA to 1A in 7 ranges
• Resolution: 1fA to 100nA (depending on range)
• Accuracy: ±(0.05% + 200pA) on 1μA range
• Burden voltage: <20μV on most sensitive range

5.3 RESISTANCE MEASUREMENT
Four-wire resistance measurements for maximum accuracy:
• Range: 2Ω to 200MΩ  
• Test current: 1μA to 1mA (automatically selected)
• Accuracy: ±(0.05% + 1mΩ) on 2kΩ range

CAUTION: Always ensure proper connection polarity to avoid 
measurement errors or potential damage to the instrument.
