AD7682/AD7689 16-Bit, 4-Channel/8-Channel Simultaneous Sampling ADCs

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The AD7682 and AD7689 are 16-bit, charge redistribution successive approximation 
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that operate from a single 2.5 V power supply 
and feature throughput rates up to 250 kSPS.

KEY FEATURES

• Single 2.5 V power supply operation
• Low power consumption: 38 mW typical at 250 kSPS
• SPI/QSPI/MICROWIRE/DSP compatible serial interface
• Internal reference: 2.5 V, ±2 ppm/°C typical
• Temperature range: −40°C to +125°C
• 48-lead LFCSP and 48-lead LQFP packages

APPLICATIONS
• Medical instrumentation
• Industrial process control
• Automatic test equipment
• Data acquisition systems
